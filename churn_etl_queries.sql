-- Customer Churn Analysis - SQL ETL Pipeline
-- ============================================

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: Database Setup
-- ============================================
CREATE DATABASE db_Churn;
USE db_Churn;


-- ============================================
-- STEP 2: Fix data types before import
-- Converts BIT columns to VARCHAR to avoid import errors
-- ============================================

    'ALTER TABLE stg_Churn MODIFY `',
    COLUMN_NAME,
    '` VARCHAR(50) NULL;'

  AND TABLE_NAME = 'stg_Churn'
  AND DATA_TYPE = 'bit';


-- ============================================
-- STEP 3: Data Exploration - Check Distinct Values
-- Understand the spread of key categorical columns
-- ============================================

-- Gender distribution
SELECT 
    Gender,
    COUNT(Gender) AS TotalCount,
    COUNT(Gender) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stg_Churn) AS Percentage

-- Contract type distribution

-- State-wise distribution, sorted by share

    COUNT(State) AS TotalCount,
    COUNT(State) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stg_Churn) AS Percentage

-- STEP 5: Clean data and load into production table
-- Replaces nulls with sensible defaults (e.g. "No", "None", "Others")
-- and creates the final clean table used for Power BI analysis
